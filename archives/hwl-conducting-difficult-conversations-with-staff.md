Did you know that all employers have legal responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to ensure the health safety and welfare at work of their employees which  includes minimising the risk of stress-related illness or injury to employees?

Healthier workforces are more productive, and being recognised as an employer that takes the health and wellbeing of employees seriously reflects positively on the reputation and culture of any organisation.  The following sessions will support workplaces to demonstrate good practice.

### Outline

There are many reasons that produce awkward situations in workplace teams, and managers are expected to deal with these effectively so that productivity is not reduced.  Health issues, matters considered to be 'personal problems', poor performance and bad behaviour all throw up conversations that managers can perceive as difficult, and this session takes a very practical look at structuring these to be as effective as possible.
