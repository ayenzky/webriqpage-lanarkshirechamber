Did you know that all employers have legal responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to ensure the health safety and welfare at work of their employees which  includes minimising the risk of stress-related illness or injury to employees?

Healthier workforces are more productive, and being recognised as an employer that takes the health and wellbeing of employees seriously reflects positively on the reputation and culture of any organisation.  The following sessions will support workplaces to demonstrate good practice.

### Outline

We know that excessive pressure at work or outside work (or a combination of the two) can lead to stress. Stress can have a negative impact on performance and lead to physical or mental ill health. This workshop can help managers to aid employees in building their personal resilience so that they can cope better with excessive pressure, adverse events and change
